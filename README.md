# Boids

A basic simulation of boids in the C programming language using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for rendering.

## What are Boids?

Put simply, [boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) are flocking simulations. They emulate the movement of fish shoals or bird flocks which are all forms of [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence). Each object (I shall be referring to them singularly as a 'boid') has a set of rules (cohesion, separation and alignment) which can not been seen individually however when in a group of other boids a flock beings to appear, this is a demonstration of [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence).
